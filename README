Hmm, most people will never read this as they'll download with
CPANPLUS or CPAN.  Here's hoping they click on it from a link from
http://search.cpan.org/

STOP: Do you want the main documentation by typing
      "perldoc Template::Plugin::Textile" ?

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is a plugin for Textile for the Template Toolkit.

It allows you to do things like this:

  [% USE Textile -%]
  [% FILTER textile %]this is _like_ *so* *cool*[% END %]

And get back things like this:

  <p>this is <em>like</em> <strong>so* *cool</strong></p>

INSTALL
-------

Just like any other Perl module:

  tar zxf Template-Plugin-Textile-X.XX.tar.gz
  cd Template-Plugin-Textile-X.XX
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install      (as root, or with sudo, etc)

Or, if you're using the new Module::Build install method:

  tar zxf Template-Plugin-Textile-X.XX.tar.gz
  cd Template-Plugin-Textile-X.XX
  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install   (as root, or with sudo, etc)

This requires

 * The Template Toolkit version 2.06 or later
 * Text::Textile 0.5 or later
